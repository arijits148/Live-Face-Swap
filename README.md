# Live-Face-Swap

In this project I have created a live face swapping app. It's just like the popular MSQRD app or SnapChat filtering app. Here kim kardashian's face is overlaid onto my face and it's actually working in real time. The Face swapping application is basically done by using face landmark detection. 

This application lets you swap a face in images captured from the webcam with another face in other image. The application first detects faces in both images and finds its landmarks. Then it swaps the face in first image with in another image. You just have to give paths to the images run the application to swap the two faces.
